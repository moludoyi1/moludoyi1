I was born in Nigeria and moved to United States when I was a little kid, I'm currently studying cybersecurity at Brigham Young University-Idaho. I'm married to my beautiful wife Madyson and we reside in Rexburg ID.

I am a passionate cybersecurity major driven by the goal of securing and strengthening networks. I find joy in every aspect of cybersecurity, from ethical hacking to defending systems and solving complex problems. My career aspiration is to work in the cybersecurity networking field, with a focus on both offensive and defensive strategies to ensure networks are as robust as possible.

I pride myself on my ability to tackle challenges by retracing my steps and learning from every experience. My curiosity drives me to continuously explore new concepts and ask "why" to fully understand the systems I work with. Outside of academics, I enjoy solving riddles, playing sports, gaming when I have the time, and spending quality moments with loved ones.
